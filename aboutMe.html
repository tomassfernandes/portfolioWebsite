       <h1>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio,</h1>
       <p>My name is Tom치s Fernandes, and I studied Sports Science in university. Although sports and exercise have always been a significant part of my life, there is another passion that I have always pursued: film photography. Capturing the essence of a moment through the lens of an old film camera has always fascinated me.
       I also have a keen interest in editing videos. As I delved deeper into film photography and video editing, I discovered my love for colors, composition, and organization. This newfound interest inspired me to learn more about front-end engineering. The process of creating and designing the look and feel of a website, choosing colors, and laying out content is an exciting challenge.
       I was fascinated by the impact that a well-designed website can have on a user's experience, and I wanted to be a part of it.
       Since then, I have been honing my skills in front-end engineering, learning new programming languages, and creating unique websites. My journey in coding has just begun, but I am excited to see where it takes me.</p>
       <p id="about-me-lastp">In my portfolio, you will find examples of my work in film photography, video editing, and front-end engineering. I hope you enjoy browsing through my projects and getting to know more about me. Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.</p>
